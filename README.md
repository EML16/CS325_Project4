# CS325_Project4
Project 4 files for TSP

For results
1. Run makefile (this will produce a executable Driver and NNeighbor)
2. For results using Christofides Algorithm, run executable by entering "./Driver inputfilename"
3. For results using Nearest Neighbor, run executable by entering "./NNeighor inputfilename"


NOTE: Both programs output to inputfilename.tour, and will overwrite any previous data stored
in that file. For example, if you run Driver on tsp_example_1.txt and then you run NNeighbor on
tsp_example_1.txt, only the results for the last run program (nearest neighbor) will be stored in
tsp_example_1.txt.tour
